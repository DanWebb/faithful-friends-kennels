My 2 anxious rescue dogs came back to us perfectly happy without any
upset after their stay at Faithful Friends. It's such a relief to
know we have a kennels nearby where they were settled and well cared
for. A professional set up with a relaxed and welcoming feel - I can't
recommend highly enough!
