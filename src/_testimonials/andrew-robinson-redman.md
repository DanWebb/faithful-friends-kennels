Our 5 dogs have visited several times. The owners are total animal
lovers and give special care and all the attention that all boarding
dogs appreciate. It is a lovely country location so everyone has plenty
of exercise whatever the weather. I would have no hesitation in telling
all my friends about Faithful Friends Kennels. The kennels are heated
and any special diet is willingly catered for.
