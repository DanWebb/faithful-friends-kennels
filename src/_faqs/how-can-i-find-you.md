We are conveniently located at Heddon Mill on the A361, between Ilfracombe & Braunton. You may add "Braunton, EX33 2NQ" Into a Sat Nav, however, make sure to turn off the A361 where you see the sign to Faithful Friends Kennels and not before.

Our full address is:  
Darragh Lodge,  
Heddon Mill,  
Braunton N.Devon,  
EX33 2NQ

Feel free to give us a call on 07800515166 for any further help with directions.
