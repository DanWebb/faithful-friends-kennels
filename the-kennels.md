Their kennel will also include an attached outside covered run which they can move freely between during the day. We are able to provide bedding and bowls for all our guests free of charge but feel free to bring your own, sometimes this helps them get settled in.

the main A361 Barnstaple to Ilfracombe road. Amidst 15 acres of fields
and woodlands which your dog will enjoy two times a day. More detailed directions are available on the [booking page](/book).
