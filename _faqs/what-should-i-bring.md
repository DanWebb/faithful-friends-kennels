title: What Should I Bring?
---

We supply food and like to keep the dog on the same diet as they are on at home. So just let us know what your pup eats and we will handle the rest. We only ask for customers to supply food if their dogs are on a special medical diet or if the dog is feed steak, boiled chicken or raw.

We provide bedding and bowls for the duration of the stay, however, you may bring your own. Sometimes this helps dogs settle in.

If your dog requires medication or treatment please bring this along we can apply this at no extra charge.
